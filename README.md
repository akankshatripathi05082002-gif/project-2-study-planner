**Smart Study Planner**

A simple and interactive web application that generates a personalized study plan based on your subject and study hours.
Built to help students stay consistent, organized, and stress-free during exam preparation.

💡 Project Idea

Students often feel lost during exams because they don’t know:

What to study

How many hours to give

How to split time effectively

I built this project to solve that confusion.
Just enter subject name + study duration, and the app instantly generates a clean, motivational study plan.

This tool reflects my interest in HCI, UI/UX, and AI-based productivity apps.
